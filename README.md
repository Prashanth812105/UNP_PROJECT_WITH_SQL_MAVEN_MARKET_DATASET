# UNP_PROJECT_WITH_SQL_MAVEN_MARKET_DATASET

I HAVE DONE THIS PROJECT WITH UNP.
Maven Market SQL Database Project
I HVE built a comprehensive relational database using MySQL Workbench to simulate a retail business environment. The project involved designing normalized tables such as Customers, Products, and more, with proper constraints and data types. Implemented SQL queries for data manipulation and retrieval, enabling insights into customer demographics, pricing, and product details. This project showcases proficiency in SQL database design, query optimization, and real-world data modeling.
